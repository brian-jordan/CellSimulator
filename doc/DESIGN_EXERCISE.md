RPS Design Exercise:
Created card layouts for classes that could be used in the implementation of RPS:
![RunRPS Class](runRPS.jpeg "Main Class for running RPS game")
![GameType Class](gameType.jpeg "Class that maintains Game Type")
![Player Class](player.jpeg "Class that maintains player info")
![Weapon Class](weapon.jpeg "Class that maintains image info")

Cell Society Planning:
Decided on a time to meet up for a second meeting to write the project plan.
Created a Google Drive Folder to keep information about the project including a powerpoint describing the layout of the
classes and their interaction.  We also created a word document to update and use in the future as a To Do list for the
progress of our project.

Initial Images of Class Layout Slides:
